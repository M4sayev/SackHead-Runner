SackHead Runner

SackHead Runner is a 2D browser-based side-scroller where you control a SackHead - workaholic that doesn't like birds. By day, he works...By night he runs, jumping over obstacles and fending off birds by throwing bottles. Survive as long as possible and rack up your score!

🎮 Gameplay

Move Left/Right: ⬅️ / A | ➡️ / D

Jump: ⬆️ / W / Space

Throw Bottle: H (to defeat birds)

Pause: use the on-screen pause button

Restart: R

Avoid obstacles like trash cans and buckets while dodging or attacking flying birds. The game gets progressively faster and more challenging as you score points.

⚡ Notes

This project has been in development a year or so ago. I recently added a little extra logic but kept the original gameplay intact.

Browser audio restrictions are handled by starting muted and fading in volume on load.
